         demonstrating outstanding academic performance. This programme supports those who need
         additional financial assistance to continue their education. The scholarship not only
         acknowledges exceptional achievements but also provides long-term support through a

         assistance until they complete their studies. This programme is designed to alleviate financial
         stress over multiple years of their education, allowing students to focus on their academic and
         personal growth without worrying about tuition or other educational expenses. Educational
